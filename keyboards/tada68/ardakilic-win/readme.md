# Ardakilic's TADA68 layout for Windows

This layout aims to use Ansi keyboard for my needs in ease, especially to work on macOS, and to have a layout more similar to Apple keyboards.

This layout aims to have a similar layout to Apple keyboards while using ISO layouts with the ANSI keymap. The layout is directly considered using Turkish Qwerty keyboards.

The changes that were applied over default layout:

* Adding a power (`KC_POWER`) key, so the lock screen shortcut works.
* Re-use the page up and page down keys to make ["Ã©] (`KC_NONUS_BSLASH`) and [<>|] (`KC_GRAVE`) keys more accessible.
* Optimize the function layer, by adding additional media keys.
* Swap the positions of volume up and volume down and mute buttons on function layer, so these keys are actually with the same order as Apple keyboard layout.

I'm re-purposing page up and page down keys in this layout, because in macOS alt/option + arrow keys, in Windows and Linux, space bar/shift spacebar combinations already cover their work, and is more accessible if you'd ask me.
